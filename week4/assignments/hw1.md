## Assignment Homework 1

### Part 1

Parse the data to a suitable format for the tools that you are using â€“ you can find two files (in JS, TXT, and CSV formats) that contain the data used to make the visualizations here, which is a subset of the data on the GISTEMP site. Visualize the data in any meaningful way you wish.

For submission, you must upload an image (or a URL to a website displaying an image) of your visualization for evaluation. In addition to your visualizations, please include a paragraph that helps explain your submission. Here are a few questions that your paragraph could answer:

- What are your x- and y-axes?
- Did you use a subset of the data? If so, what was it?
- Are there any particular aspects of your visualization to which you would like to bring attention?
- What do you think the data and your visualization shows?

Include your code in a file named `gistemp.py`and the written portions in `README.txt`.

### Part 2

For this portion of assignment, your job is to showcase geojson data. You can use whatever data you want, just make to provide the source of the data and a description of how you got it. I expect your data and visualization to include multiple data types (points, polygons, lines, etc). In addition to the actual visualization, which you should upload in your github repo, I expect you to write a small description as why you chose the particular dataset, any interesting results, and how we expand your project. 

Include your code in a file named `geo.py` and the written portions in `README.txt`.
