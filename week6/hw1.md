## Assignment 1

This assignment will involve applying the algorithms you've learned in class to a simulated real-life problem, credit card fraud detection. You'll be required to use [Kaggle](kaggle.com), so make sure to create an account as a first step. 

From there, read the spects [here](https://www.kaggle.com/dalpozz/creditcardfraud). In addition to a submission, write a small report including the following:

1. Your process throughout the entire project, i.e. why you began with a certain algorithm, why you might have switched to another, etc. Make sure to include justifications for your individual decisions.

2. Evaluate your actual outcome. Did your algorithm perform well? Was there anything you could have done to improve it?
